in todays class i just had to make and run a docker image
first i created the html file using the boilerplate
then i created the docker file and installed all the nginx stuff and whatnot manually on the terminal
finally i created docker image using "docker build -t <tag-name> ."
make sure to include the "." there
finally to run the image "docker run -d -p 8080:80 <tag-name>"
